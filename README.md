## ABMS of the interaction between bees, flowers and insecticides using stochastic differential equations

#### Authors: Julio César Franco Ardila, Pablo Osorio López, Nicholas Rose and Paula Alejandra Escudero Marı́n

##### Purpose

The aim is to model the behavior dynamics of bees, flowers and pesticides, particularly the neonicotinoids, in order to analyze the impact that this pesticide has on the life of bees and how this is harmful to the development of the ecosystem as the pollination process of the flowers. The main characteristic of the model is the implementation of systems of stochastic differential equations for the modeling of the movement of the agents, which according to [1] results are more consistent with reality.
